# Hello There?
<br/>
Hey there,  

If you are reading this, hopefully you've found some other posts helpful and have continued stumbling to this first post.
I just want to write a quick quib on why I've decided to start this journal. A lot of this will be captured in the about section but I will elaborate a little more here.

### 1. Mental Bookkeeping

Through out a day you come across a lot of interesting topics, information, whatever it may be. For me, this is one of the main reasons we do this job/hobby/etc. 

A diary is one of those personal time tracking tools that have stood the test of time. It has many benefits; the two primary for me are the reinforcement of the now and the reminder for the future. The now simply validates what you've done in a day and gives it a little added significance. It also forces you to go through your day and take out the good, bad, and everything in between. The second part, regarding the future, is simple. I want a public place that I can use to remind me on what I've forgotten or just a little pick me up ;). I'm sure you have your own reasons and I love to hear about them.

This leads into the next point...

### 2. Open Discussion

Much like those Socratic ideas of the past, I believe the discussion is the best way to really put to the test what you think you know. What is knowledge anyways? Either way, hearing input from others breaks you out of your bubble and forces you to think in a different way. In its best form, you gain much more knowledge about a topic then you would have originally thought possible. In its worst, you play the opposite role, and perhaps correct or educate others.

### 3. The Business End

Ugh. Yes, it feels like almost every developer has a blog. If it is so prevelant, perhaps it has a purpose. The most obvious to me is the exposure, it's like professional social media for developers. It is common to see "Must of have public blog" on a job posting. It proves you can articulate yourself and you are continously learning which are very key attributes for a developer.

And honestly, I haven't done much personal writing since the days of highschool... You are ignorant to things you never do, so maybe I do need a little brush up.

### 4. Front-end Dev What?

I spend most of my time working on the command line. Whether its through work (currently C++ embedded) or writing CLI tools to make my life easier (in VIM), I never get a chance to do anything that has the average computer user in my consideration. 

It is fun to change it up. My goal here is to make a simple aesthetic design in as little time as possible. I hope to work on more elaborate designs in other project... perhaps the websites for the amazing stuff I'll be making.

### Le Conclussion

Really, this was just a filler post, something to get my feet wet. It will give some context though on future posts, and of course, remind me why I started this in the first place.

Cheers,

Dzlyy
