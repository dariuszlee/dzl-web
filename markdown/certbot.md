I decided to finally get to HTTPS'ing my site today and I try to do things as light-weight as possible. This requires a CA (aka. Certificate Authority) to sign your encryption certificates. That usually means you need to pay something... however, I'd heard of the LetsEncrypt project a while ago so I decided to set it up. 

Here are my findings and the process required to achieve the same results. If you just want the implementation, scroll to that section further down the page. I used an Nginx server on a Debian machine.

<br>
### Why do we need CAs?
<br>

CAs are an added layer of security to the internet. If we have HTTPS (Secure HTTP) as a security layer before HTTP in OSI terms, then we can consider CAs as a layer slightly below HTTPS. This is a bit of a simplification but if our certificate isn't authorized, we will not continue with HTTPS handshake.

OKAY, why do we need this? A Certificate Authority says "This Certificate belongs to this domain/ip address". So why do we need this? If someone has access to your connection and you attempt to access HTTPS_SITE_X you expect the interaction to be encrypted. If we didn't have a CA he could intercept the request, hand you a random certificate (that he has the key for), and now can decrypt the traffic. Since the certificate he hands you HOPEFULLY isn't generated by a CA, the request would fail (more precisely your browser should warn you). This is called a man-in-the-middle attack.

Since your browser does most of the "behind-the-scenes" work for you, it manages CAs. You can get a list of CAs for your browser by looking online. Most of these CA authorities will charge you a fee to get a "Authorized" certificate. You would then use this certificate with your web server then voila... HTTPS.

<br>
### The LetsEncrypt Project
<br>

Thankfully, the LetsEncrypt project exists. This certificate authority is trusted by most browsers (if it wasn't, the project wouldn't solve any problems). The project is part of the Linux Foundation and is aimed at "encrypting" the entire web. In plain terms: "This is free, so please secure your site".

How does it work? Simply, you install a client on your server that can communicate with LetsEncrypt. Then, LetsEncrypt verifies the domain name by looking it up in a DNS and ensures that the client is on the same address as the DNS entry. Then you are issued a certificate, signed by LetsEncrypt, for your domain.

Now you have a certificate trusted by most browsers!

<br>
### Implementation
<br>

It appears the most popular client (mentioned earlier) that you must install on the machine that your web server resides, is called "Certbot".

My machine was Debian-based and used Nginx as the server. I installed like so:

`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot`
<br>
`sudo apt-get update`
<br>
`sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx`
<br>

Next I ran the following command:

`sudo certbot --nginx`
<br>

If it doesn't automatically configure you webserver for you, run:

`sudo certbot certificates`
<br>

You will get a line like this:
<pre><code>
$ sudo certbot certicates
Found the following certs:
  Certificate Name: dzlyysoftware.com
	Domains: dzlyysoftware.com
	Expiry Date: (Some date)
	Certificate Path: (Some path)
	Private Key Path: (Some path)
</code></pre>
<br>

Use these paths to configure your web server, what ever it may be.

<br>
## Conclusion
<br>

The implementation details will vary and it may not be so staight forward. Lots of the features for Certbot are experimental.

The reasoning and process is the same, so hopefully you know the usefulness of this project and can thank (and donate) to the project when you can.


All the best,
Darius
