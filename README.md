# My Simple Website

I don't use social media, I don't have front end experience, I don't have a blog.....

I'll make a website that accomplishes all of this!
I use this website as a journal to write about what I do on a daily basis in an attempt to keep me focused... And to help the other newbs out there.


If its a little bland, then it is a work in progress.
